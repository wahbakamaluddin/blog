- What is problem solving in a programmer POV?

  - Taking the statement of a problem and develop a computer program to solve the problem
  - A solution is a computer program written in programming language consists of module (e.g dunciton, method, class, etc)
  - A good computer program (solution) consists of modules that:
    - Organize data collection to facilitate operations
    - Store, move and alter data
    - Use algorithms to communicate with one another
- What is algorithm?

  - A step-by-step procedure to perform a task in a finite amount of time
  - It operate on a collection of data
  - It’s a problem solving using logic
  - A well-defined instructions in algorithm include:
    - Input
    - Processing
    - Output
  - Basic Control Structures;
    - Sequential
    - Selection
    - Repetition
  - Techniques to design algorithm:
    - Pseudocode
    - Flowchart
    - State Machine
    -
- What is Abstract Data Type (ADT)?
  - It’s a high-level conceptual model for organizing and working with data in cs, it defines sets of operations that can be preformed on the data.
- What is Data Structure?
  - A way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
  - Choosing the right data structure will affect the efficiency of an algorithm implementation
  - Operations to data structure
    - traversing
    - searching
    - insertion
    - deletion
    - sorting
    - merging
  - What are 2 data structure types (how data is organized and stored)?

    - **Primitive Data Structures**: These are basic data types provided by programming languages, like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and pointers.
    - **Non-Primitive Data Structures**: These are more complex structures created by combining primitive data types or other non-primitive structures, like arrays, structures, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. They help organize and manage data in various ways.
